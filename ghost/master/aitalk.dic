QUICK SAKURASCRIPT TAG REFERENCE:

\b[0] - Small balloon
\b[2] - Big balloon
â†‘ Every dialogue MUST start with one of these, *no exceptions.* It has to be the very first thing or the balloons won't do style/shape properly

\n - Linebreak
\w8 - Pause for 400 ms
\w4 - Pause for 200 ms
NOTE: I have code set up to add pauses after common punctuation (if I missed any, tell me and I can add it)
When you write punctuation, if it is followed by a space, it will add a pause automatically. If you put something else in place of a space, it won't add the pause. So "Test. Test." will have a pause after the first Test, but "Test.\_w[0] Test." will not have any pauses. (That \_w[0] tag adds a pause of 0ms, i'm just using it as a dummy tag to prevent autopause from kicking in)

To add an envelope: %(envelope_name_here)
So to add the envelope "food", you'd put %(food)
